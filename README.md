# She Connects

**She Connects** is an AI-powered platform where women can anonymously share their stories and connect with others based on shared experiences. The platform leverages natural language processing (NLP) to match users based on keywords and sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Anonymous Story Submission**: Users can share their stories without revealing their identity.
- **AI-Powered Matching**: Stories are matched based on keyword overlap and sentiment proximity.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React and Material-UI for a clean and responsive design.

## Architecture

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: A React application for user interaction.
2. **Backend**: A Flask REST API for story submission and matching, with an AI layer for NLP processing.
